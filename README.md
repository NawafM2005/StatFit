StatFit is an iOS application designed to help fitness enthusiasts create, save, and manage their workout splits and plans efficiently. Developed using SwiftUI, StatFit offers secure login and registration with FirebaseAuth, and allows users to customize and manage their profiles, track fitness goals, and monitor progress. Users can create and manage multiple workout splits in the HomeView, with real-time data storage and synchronization via Firestore. The app enables detailed workout planning, setting specific exercises for each day, and dynamically adjusting plans based on performance. The StatsView tracks and visualizes workout statistics, including total workouts, most used splits, and time spent on each split. StatFit uses the Combine framework for handling asynchronous events and data binding within SwiftUI. The app is currently in beta and will be updated regularly with new features and improvements.
